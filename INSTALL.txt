INSTALL NOTES (hAbcGeomExport)
=============



This is by no means an 'official' package of any kind, so don't expect installers.

Below is a description on how to build this package. Make sure you always work in
a console that have the Houdini environment set up (source the 'houdini_setup_bash'
shell script on linux, or open a Houdini Command Line on windows).

Also, I never did a Windows build. It shouldn't be difficult, though. :)



How to build/install
--------------------


- Download Alembic and build it.

- Open the Makefile in a text editor, and set all the INCDIRS and LIBDIRS paths
	to point at the appropriate locations (the places where you have your Alembic
	and OpenEXR include files and compiled libs, basically).

- Type 'make' or use the ./build.sh script to build.

- Use the './link.sh' shell script to install the SOHO scripts to your Houdini prefs
	folder (it creates only links, actually) -- or copy them yourself by hand.

- In the './otls' folder use the './otl_build.sh' script to build the ROP otl for
	the soho-based exporter.


That's it, basically. If you launch Houdini from the console, you should see lines like

> ** abcexportctrl (hscript) 0.03 ** (compiled Dec 17 2011, 17:32:46) DEBUG build
> ** hAbcGeomExport ROP 0.03 ** (compiled Dec 17 2011, 17:32:41) DEBUG build

meaning the libraries are available.




Testing
-------

To build the example hip file(s), go to the ./data folder in a shell and
type
	./hip_build.sh

This will build .hip file(s) from their extracted versions (they are stored in
an unpacked ascii format for version control).



You might need to do some library path setting adjustments in order for everything
to work. For quick testing, I use a shell script for that, it's

	./data/test.sh

This script uses LD_LIBRARY_PATH to set some library paths explicitly, which
is a quick hack. I don't recommend that as a permanent solution -- compile with
the exact same lib versions that Houdini uses, or go for full static linking,
if possible (?).
